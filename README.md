Student Performance Prediction

This repository contains code for predicting student performance based on demographic and socioeconomic factors using logistic regression. The project utilizes R packages such as tidyverse, tidymodels, and janitor for data manipulation, modeling, and analysis.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project is studentInfo.csv, which includes information about students' demographics, socioeconomic status, and final exam results.

Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/student-performance-prediction.git
Install R Packages: Make sure you have the necessary R packages installed. You can install them using:
R
Copy code
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "tidymodels", "janitor", "rsample"))
Run the Code: Open the R script student_performance_prediction.R in your R environment and run the code. This script performs data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
Review Results: After running the code, review the results obtained from the logistic regression model, including accuracy metrics and predictions.
Workflow

Data Preprocessing: The data is read from studentInfo.csv and preprocessed to create relevant features and factors.
Model Training: A logistic regression model is trained using the training dataset.
Model Evaluation: The model is evaluated using the testing dataset to assess its performance and accuracy.
Files Included

studentInfo.csv: The dataset containing student information.
student_performance_prediction.R: R script for data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
README.md: This README file providing an overview of the project.
